# code-quiz

This week's challenge was to make a quiz game. I chose to make a quiz based on Marvel comics. Unfortunately I was not able to complete the project in time. There are many bugs in the program and I was unable to get the "high score" function to work. Overall though, I really enjoyed working on this project and plan on completing it in the future. Additionally, I feel that this project gave me a better understanding of JavaScript which is probably the reason it is difficult to turn in this assignment before I can complete it.
